= Knative Client
:experimental:
:greeter-image: quay.io/rhdevelopers/knative-tutorial-greeter:quarkus

https://github.com/knative/client[Knative Client] is the command line utility aimed at enhancing the developer experience when doing Knative Serving and Eventing tasks.

At the end of this chapter you will be able to :

* Install Knative Client 
* Create, update, list and delete Knative service
* Create, update, list and delete Knative service revisions
* List Knative service routes

[WARNING]
====
* Knative Client (`kn`) is still under aggressive development, so commands and options might change rapidly. 
* As of writing the tutorial v0.2.0 was the latest version of the Knative Client
====

[#kn-install]
== Install

Download the https://github.com/knative/client/releases/tag/v0.2.0[latest] Knative Client and add to your `PATH`.

Verify installation by running the command:

[#kn-verify-install]
[source,bash]
----
kn version
----
copyToClipboard::kn-verify-install[]

The above command will return a response like 

[source,bash]
----
Version:      v0.2.0

[#kn-ksvc]
== Knative Service Commands

In the  xref:02-basic-fundas.adoc[previous chapter] you created, updated and deleted the Knative service using the YAML and kubectl/oc command line tools.

We will perform the same operations in this chapter but with `kn`: 

[#kn-create-ksvc]
=== Create Service

To create the `greeter` service using `kn` run the following command:

[#kn-create-ksvc-greeter]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn service create greeter --namespace {tutorial-namespace} --image {greeter-image}
----
copyToClipboard::kn-create-ksvc-greeter[]

A successful create of the `greeter` service should show a response like 

[source,bash]
----
Service 'greeter' successfully created in namespace 'knativetutorial'.
Waiting for service 'greeter' to become ready ... OK

Service URL:
http://greeter.knativetutorial.example.com
----

[#kn-list-services]
=== List Knative Services

You can list the created services using the command:

[#kn-list-ksvc]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn service list --namespace {tutorial-namespace}
----
copyToClipboard::kn-list-ksvc[]

[#kn-invoke-service]
=== Invoke Service
ifndef::workshop[]
[tabs]
====
Kubernetes::
+
--
:k8s-env: minikube
:k8s-cli: kubectl
:doc-sec: bis
include::ROOT:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tags=**;!workshop-call;!workshop-call-params]
--
OpenShift::

--
:k8s-env: openshift
:k8s-cli: oc
:doc-sec: bis
include::ROOT:partial$invoke-service.adoc[tag=workshop-call]
--
====
endif::[]

You can xref:02-basic-fundas.adoc#basics-see-what-you-have-deployed[verify] what you the kn client has deployed, to make sure its inline with what you have see in previous chapter.

[#kn-update-ksvc]
=== Update Knative Service

To create a new revision using `kn` is as easy as running another command.

In previous chapter we deployed a new revision of Knative service by adding an environment variable. Lets try do the same thing with `kn` to trigger a new deployment:

[#run-kn-update-ksvc]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn service update greeter --env "MESSAGE_PREFIX=Namaste"
----
copyToClipboard::run-kn-update-ksvc[]

Now <<kn-invoke-service,Invoking the service>> will return me a response like **Namaste  greeter => '9861675f8845' : 1**

[#kn-desc-ksvc]
=== Describe Knative Service

Sometime you wish you get the YAML of the Knative service to build a new service or to compare with with another service. `kn` makes it super easy for you to get the YAML:

[#run-kn-desc-ksvc]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn service describe greeter
----
copyToClipboard::run-kn-desc-ksvc[]

The describe should show you an exhaustive YAML like

[source,yaml]
----
include::ROOT:example$03-knative-client/kn_ksvc_desc.yaml[]
----

[#kn-delete-ksvc]
=== Delete Knative Service

[NOTE]
====
If you are going to work with other `kn` commands <<kn-revisions,Revisions>> and <<kn-routes,Routes>>, then run these exercises after those commands
====

You can also use `kn` to delete the service that were created, to delete the service named `greeter` run the following command:

[#run-kn-delete-ksvc]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn service delete greeter
----
copyToClipboard::run-kn-delete-ksvc[]

A successful delete should show an output like 

[source,bash]
----
Service 'greeter' successfully deleted in namespace 'knativetutorial'.
----

<<kn-list-services,Listing services>> you will notice that the `greeter` service no longer exists.

[#kn-revisions]
== Knative Revision Commands

The `kn` revision commands are used to interact with revision(s) of Knative service.

[#kn-revisions-list]
=== List Revisions

You can list the available revisions of a Knative service using:

[#run-kn-list-rev]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn revision list
----
copyToClipboard::run-kn-list-rev[]

The command should show a list of revisions like

[source,bash]
----
NAME            SERVICE   AGE   CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
greeter-7cqzq   greeter   11s   4 OK / 4     True
greeter-qctxv   greeter   56s   4 OK / 4     True
----

[#kn-revisions-desc]
=== Describe Revision

To get the details about a specific revision you can use the command:

[#run-kn-desc-rev]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn revision describe greeter-7cqzq
----
copyToClipboard::run-kn-desc-rev[]

The command should return a YAML like

[source,yaml]
----
include::ROOT:example$03-knative-client/kn_rev_desc.yaml[]
----

[#kn-revisions-delete]
=== Delete Revision

To delete a specific revision you can use the command:

[#run-kn-del-rev]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn revision delete greeter-7cqzq
----
copyToClipboard::run-kn-del-rev[]

The command should return an output like

[source,bash]
----
Revision 'greeter-7cqzq' successfully deleted in namespace 'knativetutorial'.
----

Now <<kn-invoke-service, invoking service>> will return the response from revision `greeter-6m45j`.

[#kn-routes]
== Knative Route Commands

The `kn` revision commands are used to interact with route(s) of Knative service.

[#kn-routes-list]
=== List Routes

[#run-kn-rt-list]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn route list
----
copyToClipboard::run-kn-rt-list[]

The command should return an output like

[source,bash]
----
NAME      URL                                          AGE   CONDITIONS   TRAFFIC
greeter   http://greeter.knativetutorial.example.com   10m   3 OK / 3     100% -> greeter-zd7jk
----

[TIP]
====
As an exercise you can run the exercises of xref:02-basic-fundas.adoc[previous chapter] and try listing the routes using `kn`.
====

[#kn-cleanup]
== Cleanup

[#cleanup-kn-delete-ksvc]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
kn service delete greeter
----
copyToClipboard::cleanup-kn-delete-ksvc[]
